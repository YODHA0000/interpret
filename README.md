interpreting deep neural network models


The inspiration for interpreting deep neural networks is from the thread of papers from Chris Olah(https://colah.github.io/about.html)
The link for the thread is https://distill.pub/2020/circuits/zoom-in/
It explians about the connections between the neurons and the neurons themselves.

It uses the Lucid package ,exact versions of what is required is mentioned in requirements file.
